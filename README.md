I'm rubbish at Countdown, I can never solve the anagrams. I thought that there was no way dictionary corner could possibly come up with so many possible anagrams without some help. I created a programme which takes up to 9 letters and returns all of the different words that can be made, longest words at the top of the list. The 'show definitions' button links to a dictionary API but as the code is client side this button only works if you circumvent the single-origin policy on your browser.
